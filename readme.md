# bmesh

*Tooling to work with the Minecraft Legends model format*

## Usage

Currently very early, only has ability to convert a model's raw verts/normals/UVs to OBJ:

`bmesh obj path/to/model.json output.obj`

TODO:
- Convert Back
- Handle Materials
- Handle Bones
    - probably support something more complex than OBJ in service of this
